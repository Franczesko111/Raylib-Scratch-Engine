# Snapling Engine #
A scratch inspired game engine made with C++ using the Raylib game library.

# App is damaged. What should I do?
When this happens, open your terminal and type this command which turns of the gatekeeper on your MacOS (don't worry, you can enable it later!)

`sudo spctl --master-disable`

Then, write this command and drag the Fetch Engine app to the terminal:

`xattr -cr {PATH_NAME}`

And when you're done you can re-enable the gatekeeper:

`sudo spctl --master-enable`

After that everything should work again!

# It's still not working? #
In the future I'll make a dmg file so it's easier and safer to download which (hopefully) won't make the program break! For now the engine doesn't have much, so you're not missing out... yet :P
